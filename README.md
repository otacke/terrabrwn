# TerraBrwn

##What's this?
TerraBrwn is **to become** a WordPress PlugIn that allows you to attach multiple geolocations to posts. Those locations will be presented as markers on a GoogleMap that could e.g. be embedded on the front page. This map will have different features:

 - link markers to posts (done)
 - use individual markers depending on post category (done) 
 - offer a different map design at day or at night that will change automatically on sunrise or sunset (done)
 - allow individual welcome messages depending on user's location (open)
 - filter posts, e. g. by category or age (open)

## More information
"Why", you ask? I was asked if I could pull this off by some friends who need exactly that functionality, and they said there was nothing appropriate available for WordPress :-) TerraBrwn is working for them, but **the code is really a mess right now**. My coding skills are pretty limited, but I hope to improve them with this project. As I am writing these lines, there's a lot to do: refactoring, make settings optional instead of hard coding them, refactoring again, add missing features, fine tuning, probably more refactoring, etc...

*If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know!*
